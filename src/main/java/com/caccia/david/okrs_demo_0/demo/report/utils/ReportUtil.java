        We want to take a set of reports and output a (for now) text report.  Perhaps a stretch goal would be to output
        a formatted report, maybe md or html or pdf?

        What if ids were not text.  What if they were a list of ids, in order of hierarchy?
        That would make some aspect of report creation easier.  It might also make team navigation easier too.
